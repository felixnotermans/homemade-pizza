## Homemade Pizza

### Grocery List
- Flour, preferably 00 type (Harina)
- Yeast, preferably fresh (levadura fresca)
- Salt
- Water

### Ratios
if (flour === 100%) {
  water: 57%
  salt: 3%;
  fresh yeast: 0,2%;
}

(For one pizza ball of 250gr you need 156gr of flour)

### Activating the yeast
Add between 75-100ml of lukewarm (38Â°C) into a bowl,
add a tablespoon of flour and a teaspoon of sugar, stir and then mix in the yeast.
Cover and let rest until it starts to foam (this means the yeast is activated!).
Remember to subtract the flour and water you use here from the ratio!

### Mixing, kneading and resting
Mix the flour with the salt. Don't add the salt to the yeast substance because salt and yeast are not best friends. Once the flour and salt have mixed, add in the water and the yeast substance. Mix well together until all ingredients are combined. Now cover and rest for 10 min.

After a little rest, you want to knead the dough. The longer you need, the easier the pizza becomes to handle. Ideally, knead for about 20 mins (if you don't have a kneading machine then consider today's upper-body workout done).

Now rest the big ball for 2 hours. If you have made dough for multiple pizzas, divide the ball into smaller balls and let them rest for another 4 hours. If it's just for 1 pizza, then rest the initial ball for a total of 6 hours.

### Forming the pizza
This can be done in various ways, but always keep in mind not to flatten the rim. The center part should be thin, but the rim should remain big. Gravity is your friend when forming the pizza!

### Sauce and toppings
For the sauce go for a good quality can of sieved tomato (try Mutti, they also have a great pizza sauce that already has some herbs in it) and add some oregano and olive oil. For cheese you want to mix some mozzarella with parmezan cheese. After that the toppings are up to you, but remember, no pineapple!
